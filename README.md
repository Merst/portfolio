I needed a central repository where I could describe and demonstrate the various projects I worked on over the years. Thus, I decided to build a full-stack web application using frameworks that uses Python and Javascript as languages. 

While a few static html pages, along with some css might have been sufficient to present an acceptable display, it would be heavily lacking in reusability for other projects in the future that might require more complex functionalities.

By following a microservice architecture, the ui, api and databases can be easily reused as templates, stemming from a working state whenever needed.

Another objective of this project is to  explore different deployment strategies, along with the different configurations required for the application to run properly.
